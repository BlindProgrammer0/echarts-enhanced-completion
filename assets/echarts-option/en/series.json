One or more series (like &quot;Beijing&quot;, &quot;Shanghai&quot;, and &quot;Guangzhou&quot; in the above example) can share one coordinate system. Like other coordinate systems, multiple parallel coordinate systems can be created in one echarts instance. Position setting is also carried out here.\n* [parallelAxis][3] This is axis configuration. Multiple axes are needed in parallel coordinates. [parallelAxis.parallelIndex][5] is used to specify which coordinate system this axis belongs to. The first coordinate system is used by default.\n* [series-parallel][4] This is the definition of parallel series, which will be drawn on parallel coordinate system. [parallelAxis.parallelIndex][5] is used to specify which coordinate system this axis belongs to. The first coordinate system is used by default.\n\n**Notes and Best Practices** When configuring multiple [parallelAxis][3], there might be some common attributes in each axis configuration. To avoid writing them repeatly, they can be put under [parallel.parallelAxisDefault][6]. Before initializing axis, configurations in [parallel.parallelAxisDefault][6] will be merged into [parallelAxis][3] to generate the final axis configuration. **If data is too large and cause bad performance** It is suggested to set [series-parallel.lineStyle.width][7] to be 0.5 (or less), which may improve performance significantly. **Display High-Dimension Data** When dimension number is extremely large, say, more than 50 dimensions, there will be more than 50 axes, which may hardly display in a page. In this case, you may use [parallel.axisExpandable][8] to improve the display.

This render logic is called [renderItem][4]. For example: \n\n    var option = {\n        ...,\n        series: [{\n            type: 'custom',\n            renderItem: function (params, api) {\n                var categoryIndex = api.value(0);\n                var start = api.coord([api.value(1), categoryIndex]);\n                var end = api.coord([api.value(2), categoryIndex]);\n                var height = api.size([0, 1])[1] * 0.6;\n    \n                var rectShape = echarts.graphic.clipRectByRect({\n                    x: start[0],\n                    y: start[1] - height / 2,\n                    width: end[0] - start[0],\n                    height: height\n                }, {\n                    x: params.coordSys.x,\n                    y: params.coordSys.y,\n                    width: params.coordSys.width,\n                    height: params.coordSys.height\n                });\n    \n                return rectShape &amp;&amp; {\n                    type: 'rect',\n                    shape: rectShape,\n                    style: api.style()\n                };\n            },\n            data: data\n        }]\n    }\n    \n\n[renderItem][4] will be called on each data item. [renderItem][4] provides two parameters: \n\n* [params][5]: provides info about the current series and data and coordinate system.\n* [api][6]: includes some methods.\n\n[renderItem][4] method should returns graphic elements definitions.See [renderItem.return][7]. Generally, the main process of [renderItem][4] is that retrieve value from data and convert them to graphic elements on the current coordinate system. Two methods in [renderItem.arguments.api][6] are always used in this procedure: \n\n* [api.value(...)][8] is used to retrieve value from data. For example, api.value(0) retrieve the value of the first dimension in the current data item.\n* [api.coord(...)][9] is used to convert data to coordinate. For example, var point = api.coord([api.value(0), api.value(1)]) converet the data to the point on the current coordinate system.\n\nSometimes [api.size(...)][10] method is needed, which calculates the size on the coordinate system by a given data range. Moreover, [api.style(...)][11] method can be used to set style. It provides not only the style settings specified in [series.itemStyle][12], but also the result of visual mapping. This method can also be called like api.style({fill: 'green', stroke: 'yellow'}) to override those style settings.   \n**Dimension mapping (by encode and dimension option)** In most cases, [series.encode][13] needs to be specified when using custom series series, which indicate the mapping of dimensions, and then echarts can render appropriate axis by the extent of those data. encode.tooltip and encode.label can also be specified to define the content of default tooltip and label. [series.dimensions][14] can also be specified to defined names of each dimensions, which will be displayed in tooltip. For example: \n\n    series: {\n        type: 'custom',\n        renderItem: function () {\n            ...\n        },\n        encode: {\n            x: [2, 4, 3],\n            y: 1,\n            label: 0,\n            tooltip: [2, 4, 3]\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n  \n**Controlled by dataZoom** When use custom series with [dataZoom][0], [dataZoom.filterMode][15] usually be set as 'weakFilter', which prevent dataItem from being filtered when only part of its dimensions are out of the current data window.   \n  \n**Difference between dataIndex and dataIndexInside*** dataIndex is the index of a dataItem in the original data.\n* dataIndexInside is the index of a dataItem in the current data window (see [dataZoom][0].\n\n[renderItem.arguments.api][6] uses dataIndexInside as the input parameter but not dataIndex, because conversion from dataIndex to dataIndexInside is time-consuming.   \n**Event listener**    chart.setOption({\n        // ...\n        series: {\n            type: 'custom',\n            renderItem: function () {\n                // ...\n                return {\n                    type: 'group',\n                    children: [{\n                        type: 'circle'\n                        // ...\n                    }, {\n                        type: 'circle',\n                        name: 'aaa',\n                        // User specified info, available\n                        // in event handler.\n                        info: 12345,\n                        // ...\n                    }]\n                };\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    chart.on('click', {element: 'aaa'}, function (params) {\n        // When the element with name 'aaa' clicked,\n        // this method called.\n        console.log(params.info);\n    });\n    \n\n\n\n[0]: #dataZoom\n[1]: #visualMap\n[2]: https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html#chart-type-custom\n[3]: tutorial.html#Custom%20Series\n[4]: #series-custom.renderItem\n[5]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.params\n[6]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.api\n[7]: #series-custom.renderItem.return\n[8]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.api.value\n[9]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.api.coord\n[10]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.api.size\n[11]: #series-custom.renderItem.arguments.api.style\n[12]: #series-custom.itemStyle\n[13]: #series-custom.encode\n[14]: #series-custom.dimensions\n[15]: #dataZoom.filterMode",
