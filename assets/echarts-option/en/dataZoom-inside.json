        "desc": "Generally `dataZoom` component zoom or roam coordinate system through data filtering and set the windows of axes internally.\n\nIts behaviours vary according to filtering mode settings ([dataZoom.filterMode](~dataZoom.filterMode)).\n\nPossible values:\n\n+ 'filter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered if one of the relevant dimensions is out of the window.\n\n+ 'weakFilter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered only if all of the relevant dimensions are out of the same side of the window.\n\n+ 'empty': data that outside the window will be **set to NaN**, which will not lead to changes of windows of other axes.\n\n+ 'none': Do not filter data.\n\nHow to set `filterMode` is up to users, depending on the requirments and scenarios. Expirically:\n\n+ If only `xAxis` or only `yAxis` is controlled by `dataZoom`, `filterMode: 'filter'` is typically used, which enable the other axis auto adapte its window to the extent of the filtered data.\n\n+ If both `xAxis` and `yAxis` are operated by `dataZoom`:\n\n+ If `xAxis` and `yAxis` should not effect mutually (e.g. a scatter chart with both axes on the type of `'value'`), they should be set to be `filterMode: 'empty'`.\n\n+ If `xAxis` is the main axis and `yAxis` is the auxiliary axis (or vise versa) (e.g., in a bar chart, when dragging `dataZoomX` to change the window of xAxis, we need the yAxis to adapt to the clipped data, but when dragging `dataZoomY` to change the window of yAxis, we need the xAxis not to be changed), in this case, `xAxis` should be set to be `fiterMode: 'filter'`, while `yAxis` should be set to be `fiterMode: 'empty'`.\n\nIt can be demonstrated by the sample:\n\n```javascript\noption = {\ndataZoom: [\n{\nid: 'dataZoomX',\ntype: 'slider',\nxAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'filter'\n},\n{\nid: 'dataZoomY',\ntype: 'slider',\nyAxisIndex: [0],\nfilterMode: 'empty'\n}\n],\nxAxis: {type: 'value'},\nyAxis: {type: 'value'},\nseries{\ntype: 'bar',\ndata: [\n// The first column corresponds to xAxis,\n// and the second coloum corresponds to yAxis.\n[12, 24, 36],\n[90, 80, 70],\n[3, 9, 27],\n[1, 11, 111]\n]\n}\n}\n```\n\nIn the sample above, `dataZoomX` is set as `filterMode: 'filter'`. When use drags `dataZoomX` (do not touch `dataZoomY`) and the valueWindow of `xAxis` is changed to `[2, 50]` consequently, `dataZoomX` travel the first column of series.data and filter items that out of the window. The series.data turns out to be:\n\n```javascript\n[\n[12, 24, 36],\n// [90, 80, 70] This item is filtered, as 90 is out of the window.\n[3, 9, 27]\n// [1, 11, 111] This item is filtered, as 1 is out of the window.\n]\n```\n\nBefore filtering, the second column, which corresponds to yAxis, has values `24`, `80`, `9`, `11`. After filtering, only `24` and `9` are left. Then the extent of `yAxis` is adjusted to adapt the two values (if `yAxis.min` and `yAxis.max` are not set).\n\nSo `filterMode: 'filter'` can be used to enable the other axis to auto adapt the filtered data.\n\nThen let's review the sample from the beginning, `dataZoomY` is set as `filterMode: 'empty'`. So if user drags `dataZoomY` (do not touch `dataZoomX`) and its window is changed to `[10, 60]` consequently, `dataZoomY` travels the second column of series.data and set NaN to all of the values that outside the window (NaN cause the graphical elements, i.e., bar elements, do not show, but still hold the place). The series.data turns out to be:\n\n```javascript\n[\n[12, 24, 36],\n[90, NaN, 70], // Set to NaN\n[3, NaN, 27],  // Set to NaN\n[1, 11, 111]\n]\n```\n\nIn this case, the first column (i.e., `12`, `90`, `3`, `1`, which corresponds to `xAxis`), will not be changed at all. So dragging `yAxis` will not change extent of `xAxis`, which is good for requirements like outlier filtering.\n\nSee this example:\n~[600x400](doc-example/bar-dataZoom-filterMode&edit=1&reset=1)",

And when user behavior trigger the changing of the view, the `rangeMode` would be modified automatically. For example, if triggered by `toolbox.dataZoom`, it will be modefied to `'value'`, and if triggered by `dataZoom-inside` or `dataZoom-slider`, it will be modified to `'percent'`.\n\nIf we specify `rangeMode` manually in `option`, it only works when both `start` and `startValue` specified or both `end` and `endValue` specified.
