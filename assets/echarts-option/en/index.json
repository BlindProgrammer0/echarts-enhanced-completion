These types of dataZoom component are supported: \n\n* [dataZoomInside][0]: Data zoom functionalities is embeded inside coordinate systems, enable user to zoom or roam coordinate system by mouse dragging, mouse move or finger touch (in touch screen).\n* [dataZoomSlider][1]: A special slider bar is provided, on which coordinate systems can be zoomed or roamed by mouse dragging or finger touch (in touch screen).\n* [dataZoomSelect][2]: A marquee tool is provided for zooming or roaming coordinate system.

A single chart instance can contain several dataZoom components, each of which controls different axes. The dataZoom components that control the same axis will be automatically linked (i.e., all of them will be updated when one of them is updated by user action or API call).   \n- - -\n\n**✦ How dataZoom componets operates axes and data ✦** Generally dataZoom component zoom or roam coordinate system through data filtering and set the windows of axes internally. Its behaviours vary according to filtering mode settings ([dataZoom.filterMode][7]). Possible values: \n\n* 'filter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered if one of the relevant dimensions is out of the window.\n* 'weakFilter': data that outside the window will be **filtered**, which may lead to some changes of windows of other axes. For each data item, it will be filtered only if all of the relevant dimensions are out of the same side of the window.\n* 'empty': data that outside the window will be **set to NaN**, which will not lead to changes of windows of other axes.\n* 'none': Do not filter data.\n\nHow to set filterMode is up to users, depending on the requirments and scenarios. Expirically: \n\n* If only xAxis or only yAxis is controlled by dataZoom, filterMode: 'filter' is typically used, which enable the other axis auto adapte its window to the extent of the filtered data.\n* If both xAxis and yAxis are operated by dataZoom: \n  * If xAxis and yAxis should not effect mutually (e.g. a scatter chart with both axes on the type of 'value'), they should be set to be filterMode: 'empty'.\n  * If xAxis is the main axis and yAxis is the auxiliary axis (or vise versa) (e.g., in a bar chart, when dragging dataZoomX to change the window of xAxis, we need the yAxis to adapt to the clipped data, but when dragging dataZoomY to change the window of yAxis, we need the xAxis not to be changed), in this case, xAxis should be set to be fiterMode: 'filter', while yAxis should be set to be fiterMode: 'empty'.\n\nIt can be demonstrated by the sample: \n\n    option = {\n        dataZoom: [\n            {\n                id: 'dataZoomX',\n                type: 'slider',\n                xAxisIndex: [0],\n                filterMode: 'filter'\n            },\n            {\n                id: 'dataZoomY',\n                type: 'slider',\n                yAxisIndex: [0],\n                filterMode: 'empty'\n            }\n        ],\n        xAxis: {type: 'value'},\n        yAxis: {type: 'value'},\n        series{\n            type: 'bar',\n            data: [\n                // The first column corresponds to xAxis,\n                // and the second coloum corresponds to yAxis.\n                [12, 24, 36],\n                [90, 80, 70],\n                [3, 9, 27],\n                [1, 11, 111]\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n\nIn the sample above, dataZoomX is set as filterMode: 'filter'. When use drags dataZoomX (do not touch dataZoomY) and the valueWindow of xAxis is changed to [2, 50] consequently, dataZoomX travel the first column of series.data and filter items that out of the window. The series.data turns out to be: \n\n    [\n        [12, 24, 36],\n        // [90, 80, 70] This item is filtered, as 90 is out of the window.\n        [3, 9, 27]\n        // [1, 11, 111] This item is filtered, as 1 is out of the window.\n    ]\n    \n\nBefore filtering, the second column, which corresponds to yAxis, has values 24, 80, 9, 11. After filtering, only 24 and 9 are left. Then the extent of yAxis is adjusted to adapt the two values (if yAxis.min and yAxis.max are not set). So filterMode: 'filter' can be used to enable the other axis to auto adapt the filtered data. Then let's review the sample from the beginning, dataZoomY is set as filterMode: 'empty'. So if user drags dataZoomY (do not touch dataZoomX) and its window is changed to [10, 60] consequently, dataZoomY travels the second column of series.data and set NaN to all of the values that outside the window (NaN cause the graphical elements, i.e., bar elements, do not show, but still hold the place). The series.data turns out to be: \n\n    [\n        [12, 24, 36],\n        [90, NaN, 70], // Set to NaN\n        [3, NaN, 27],  // Set to NaN\n        [1, 11, 111]\n    ]\n    \n\nIn this case, the first column (i.e., 12, 90, 3, 1, which corresponds to xAxis), will not be changed at all. So dragging yAxis will not change extent of xAxis, which is good for requirements like outlier filtering. See this example: Moreover, when min, max of an axis is set (e.g., yAxis: {min: 0, max: 400}), this extent of the axis will not be modified by the behaviour of dataZoom of other axis any more.   \n- - -\n\n**✦ How to set window ✦** You can set the current window in two forms: \n\n* percent value: see [dataZoom.start][8] and [dataZoom.end][9].\n* absolute value: see [dataZoom.startValue][10] and [dataZoom.endValue][11].\n\nNotice: If use percent value form, and it is in the scenario below, the result of dataZoom depends on the sequence of dataZoom definitions appearing in option. \n\n    option = {\n        dataZoom: [\n            {\n                id: 'dataZoomX',\n                type: 'slider',\n                xAxisIndex: [0],\n                filterMode: 'filter',   // Set as 'filter' so that the modification\n                                        // of window of xAxis willl effect the\n                                        // window of yAxis.\n                start: 30,\n                end: 70\n            },\n            {\n                id: 'dataZoomY',\n                type: 'slider',\n                yAxisIndex: [0],\n                filterMode: 'empty',\n                start: 20,\n                end: 80\n            }\n        ],\n        xAxis: {\n            type: 'value'\n        },\n        yAxis: {\n            type: 'value'\n            // Notice there is no min or max set to\n            // restrict the view extent of yAxis.\n        },\n        series{\n            type: 'bar',\n            data: [\n                // The first column corresponds to xAxis,\n                // and the second column corresponds to yAxis.\n                [12, 24, 36],\n                [90, 80, 70],\n                [3, 9, 27],\n                [1, 11, 111]\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n\nWhat is the exact meaning of start: 20, end: 80 in dataZoomY in the example above? \n\n* If yAxis.min and yAxis.max are set: start: 20, end: 80 of dataZoomY means: from 20% to 80% out of [yAxis.min, yAxis.max]. If one of yAxis.min and yAxis.max is not set, the corresponding edge of the full extend also follow rule as follows.\n* If yAxis.min and yAxis.max are not set: \n  * If dataZoomX is set to be filterMode: 'empty': start: 20, end: 80 of dataZoomY means: from 20% to 80% out of [dataMinY to dataMaxY] of series.data (i.e., [9, 80] in the example above).\n  * If dataZoomX is set to filterMode: 'filter': Since dataZoomX is defined before dataZoomY, start: 30, end: 70 of dataZoomX means: from 30% to 70% out of full series.data, whereas start: 20, end: 80 of dataZoomY means: from 20% to 80% out of the series.data having been filtered by dataZoomX.

In practice, you may often find coordinate brush to be a more frequently made choice, particularly in geo charts. By assigning [brush.geoIndex][2], or [brush.xAxisIndex][3], or [brush.yAxisIndex][4], brush selecting axes can be assigned, whose value can be: \n\n* 'all': for all axes;\n* number: like 0, for a particular coordinate with that index;\n* Array: like [0, 4, 2], for coordinates with those indexes;\n* 'none', or null, or undefined: for not assigning.\n\nExample: \n\n    option = {\n        geo: {\n            ...\n        },\n        brush: {\n            geoIndex: 'all', // brush selecting is enabled only in all geo charts above\n            ...\n        }\n    };\n    \n\nExample: \n\n    option = {\n        grid: [\n            {...}, // grid 0\n            {...}  // grid 1\n        ],\n        xAxis: [\n            {gridIndex: 1, ...}, // xAxis 0 for grid 1\n            {gridIndex: 0, ...}  // xAxis 1 for grid 0\n        ],\n        yAxis: [\n            {gridIndex: 1, ...}, // yAxis 0 for grid 1\n            {gridIndex: 0, ...}  // yAxis 1 for grid 0\n        ],\n        brush: {\n            xAxisIndex: [0, 1], // brush selecting is enabled only in coordinates with xAxisIndex as `0` or `1`\n            ...\n        }\n    };\n    \n\n  \n- - -\n\n**Control select-box with API**dispatchAction can be used to render select-box programatically. For example: \n\n    myChart.dispatchAction({\n        type: 'brush',\n        areas: [\n            {\n                geoIndex: 0,\n                // Assign select-box type\n                brushType: 'polygon',\n                // Assign select-box shape\n                coordRange: [[119.72,34.85],[119.68,34.85],[119.5,34.84],[119.19,34.77]]\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n    \n\nPlease refer to [action.brush][5] for more information.   \n- - -\n\n**brushLink** Links interaction between selected items in different series. Following is an example of enabling selected effect for scatter and parallel charts once a scatter chart is selected. brushLink is an array of seriesIndexes, which assignes the series that can be interacted. For example, it can be: \n\n* [3, 4, 5] for interacting series with seriesIndex as 3, 4, or 5;\n* 'all' for interacting all series;\n* 'none', or null, or undefined for disabling brushLink.\n\n**Attention**brushLink is a mapping of dataIndex. So **data of every series with brushLink should be guaranteed to correspond to the other**. Example: \n\n    option = {\n        brush: {\n            brushLink: [0, 1]\n        },\n        series: [\n            {\n                type: 'bar'\n                data: [232,    4434,    545,      654]     // data has 4 items\n            },\n            {\n                type: 'parallel',\n                data: [[4, 5], [3, 5], [66, 33], [99, 66]] // data also has 4 items, which correspond to the data above\n            }\n        ]\n    };\n    \n\nPlease refer to [brush.brushLink][6].   \n- - -\n\n**throttle / debounce** By default, brushSelected is always triggered when selection-box is selected or moved, to tell the outside about the event. But efficiency problems may occur when events are triggered too frequently, or the animation result may be affected. So brush components provides [brush.throttleType][7] and [brush.throttleDelay][8] to solve this problem. Valid throttleType values can be: \n\n* 'debounce': for triggering events only when the action has been stopped (no action after some duration). Time threshold can be assigned with [brush.throttleDelay][8];\n* 'fixRate': for triggering event with a certain frequency. The frequency can be assigned with [brush.throttleDelay][8].\n\nIn this [example][9], debounce is used to make sure the bar chart is updated only when the user has stopped action. In other cases, the animation result may not be so good.   \n- - -\n\n**Visual configurations of selected and unselected items** Refer to [brush.inBrush][10] and [brush.outOfBrush][11].   \n- - -\n\nHere is the configuration in detail.\n\n[0]: #toolbox.feature.brush.type\n[1]: #brush.toolbox\n[2]: #brush.geoIndex\n[3]: #brush.xAxisIndex\n[4]: #brush.yAxisIndex\n[5]: api.html#action.brush\n[6]: #brush.brushLink\n[7]: #brush.throttleType\n[8]: #brush.throttleDelay\n[9]: https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=scatter-map-brush&amp;edit=1&amp;reset=1\n[10]: #brush.inBrush\n[11]: #brush.outOfBrush",

We call first the parameter of setOption as ECOption, and call the traditional single ECharts option as ECUnitOption. \n\n* In the case that timeline and media query are not set, an ECUnitOption is an ECOption.\n* In the case that timeline or media query are set, an ECOption is made up with several ECUnitOptions.\n  * The properties at the root of ECOption form an ECUnitOption, which is also called baseOption, representing the default settings.\n  * Each item of the array options form an ECUnitOption, which can be also called switchableOption, representing options for each time tick.\n* baseOption and one switchableOption are used to calculate the finalOption, based on which the chart will be final rendered.\n\nFor example: \n\n    myChart.setOption({\n        // This is the properties of `baseOption`.\n        timeline: {\n            ...,\n            // each item in `timeline.data` corresponds to each\n            // `option` in `options` array.\n            data: ['2002-01-01', '2003-01-01', '2004-01-01']\n        },\n        title: {\n            subtext: ' Data is from National Bureau of Statistics '\n        },\n        grid: { ... },\n        xAxis: [ ... ],\n        yAxis: [ ... ],\n        series: [{\n            // other configurations of series 1\n            type: 'bar',\n            ...\n        }, {\n            // other configurations of series 2\n            type: 'line',\n            ...\n        }, {\n            // other configurations of series 3\n            type: 'pie',\n            ...\n        }],\n        // `switchableOption`s:\n        options: [{\n            // it is an option corresponding to '2002-01-01'\n            title: {\n            text: 'the statistics of the year 2002'\n            },\n            series: [\n                { data: [] }, // the data of series 1\n                { data: [] }, // the data of series 2\n                { data: [] }  // the data of series 3\n            ]\n        }, {\n            // it is an option corresponding to '2003-01-01'\n            title: {\n                text: 'the statistics of the year 2003'\n            },\n            series: [\n                { data: [] },\n                { data: [] },\n                { data: [] }\n            ]\n        }, {\n            // it is an option corresponding to '2004-01-01'\n            title: {\n                text: 'the statistics of the year 2004'\n            },\n            series: [\n                { data: [] },\n                { data: [] },\n                { data: [] }\n            ]\n        }]\n    });\n    \n\n  \n**How the finalOption calculated?** When initializing, a switchableOption corresponding to the current time tick are merged into baseOption to form the finalOption. Each time the current tick changed, the new switchableOption corresponding to the new time tick are merged into the finalOption. There are two merging strategy. \n\n* By default, use NORMAL_MERGE.\n* If [timeline.replaceMerge][0] is set, use REPLACE_MERGE. See [setOption][1] for more details of REPLACE_MERGE.\n\n  \n**Compatibility with ECharts 4:** We also support these equivalent setting styles: \n\n    option = {\n        baseOption: {\n            timeline: {},\n            series: [],\n            // ... other properties of baseOption.\n        },\n        options: []\n    };\n    \n\n\n\n[0]: #option.html#timeline.replaceMerge\n[1]: #api.html#echartsInstance.setOption",

For example: \n\n    {\n        type: 'rect',\n        shape: {\n            x: 10,\n            y: 10,\n            width: 100,\n            height: 200\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        type: 'circle',\n        shape: {\n            cx: 20,\n            cy: 30,\n            r: 100\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        type: 'image',\n        style: {\n            image: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a.png',\n            x: 100,\n            y: 200,\n            width: 230,\n            height: 400\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        type: 'text',\n        style: {\n            text: 'This text',\n            x: 100,\n            y: 200\n        }\n    \n    }\n    \n\n  \n- - -\n\n**Transforming and Absolutely Positioning of Graphic Element** Element can be transformed (translation, rotation, scale). See [position][12], [rotation][13], [scale][14], [origin][15] For example: \n\n    {\n        type: 'rect', // or any other types.\n    \n        // Translation, using [0, 0] by default.\n        position: [100, 200],\n    \n        // Scale, using [1, 1] by default.\n        scale: [2, 4],\n    \n        // Rotation, using 0 by default. Negative value means rotating clockwise.\n        rotation: Math.PI / 4,\n    \n        // Origin point of rotation and scale, using [0, 0] by default.\n        origin: [10, 20],\n    \n        shape: {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n* Each element is transformed in the coordinate system of its parent, namely, transform of a element and its parent can be &quot;stacked&quot;.\n* Transformation is performed by this order: \n  1. Translate [-el.origin[0], -el.origin[1]].\n  1. Scale according to el.scale.\n  1. Rotate according to el.rotation.\n  1. Translate back according to el.origin.\n  1. Translate according to el.position.\n* Namely, scaling and rotating firstly, and then translate. By this mechanism, translation does not affect origin of scale and rotation.\n\n  \n- - -\n\n**Relatively Positioning** In real application, size of a container is always not fixed. So mechanism of relative position is required. In graphic component, [left][16] / [right][17] / [top][18] / [bottom][19] / [width][20] / [height][21] are used to position element relatively. For example: \n\n    { // Position the image at the bottom center of its container.\n        type: 'image',\n        left: 'center', // Position at the center horizontally.\n        bottom: '10%',  // Position beyond the bottom boundary 10%.\n        style: {\n            image: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx/a.png',\n            width: 45,\n            height: 45\n        }\n    },\n    { // Position the entire rotated group at the right-bottom corner of its container.\n        type: 'group',\n        right: 0,  // Position at the right boundary.\n        bottom: 0, // Position at the bottom boundary.\n        rotation: Math.PI / 4,\n        children: [\n            {\n                type: 'rect',\n                left: 'center', // Position at horizontal center according to its parent.\n                top: 'middle',  // Position at vertical center according to its parent.\n                shape: {\n                    width: 190,\n                    height: 90\n                },\n                style: {\n                    fill: '#fff',\n                    stroke: '#999',\n                    lineWidth: 2,\n                    shadowBlur: 8,\n                    shadowOffsetX: 3,\n                    shadowOffsetY: 3,\n                    shadowColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.3)'\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                type: 'text',\n                left: 'center', // Position at horizontal center according to its parent.\n                top: 'middle',  // Position at vertical center according to its parent.\n                style: {\n                    fill: '#777',\n                    text: [\n                        'This is text',\n                        'This is text',\n                        'Print some text'\n                    ].join('\\n'),\n                    font: '14px Microsoft YaHei'\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\nNote, [bounding][22] can be used to specify whether the entire transformed element (containing children if is group) is confined in its container.\n\n[0]: #graphic.elements-image\n[1]: #graphic.elements-text\n[2]: #graphic.elements-circle\n[3]: #graphic.elements-sector\n[4]: #graphic.elements-ring\n[5]: #graphic.elements-polygon\n[6]: #graphic.elements-polyline\n[7]: #graphic.elements-rect\n[8]: #graphic.elements-line\n[9]: #graphic.elements-bezierCurve\n[10]: #graphic.elements-arc\n[11]: #graphic.elements-group\n[12]: #graphic.elements.position\n[13]: #graphic.elements.rotation\n[14]: #graphic.elements.scale\n[15]: #graphic.elements.origin\n[16]: #graphic.elements.left\n[17]: #graphic.elements.right\n[18]: #graphic.elements.top\n[19]: #graphic.elements.bottom\n[20]: #graphic.elements.width\n[21]: #graphic.elements.height\n[22]: graphic.elements.bounding",

But it brings some problems like the hovered elements may not covering everything else correctly, or translucent elements may not overlay correctly to each other. And it brings extra member cost due to the extra canvas and may bring burden on mobile devices. So since ECharts 3, the hover layer is not used by default.
